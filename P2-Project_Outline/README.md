## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is going to be a website that is going to help music venues find artist to play at their shows. Venues most of the time have a certain gerne of music they want to play at their venue.  Listening to the music on the internet is fun and enjoy able but that is just listening. I understand most bands have an agent to contact to book them. What my webiste does it list artist information. We keep the contact information of the bands in the database but on screen having to click a button to get in contact with the bands agent. 

What I want to do is be able to create a website that will list band name, genre, and money to book them. Each band will have their very own webpage that will list a short bio and what genre they play. Also on the side of the webpage will be a related artist section for those artist that are similar to the current band on page.
